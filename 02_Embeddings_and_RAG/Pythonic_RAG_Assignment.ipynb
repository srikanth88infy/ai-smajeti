    "There are three roles, and they function as follows (taken directly from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/chat-completions-api)):\n",
    "\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"system\"}` : The system message helps set the behavior of the assistant. For example, you can modify the personality of the assistant or provide specific instructions about how it should behave throughout the conversation. However note that the system message is optional and the model’s behavior without a system message is likely to be similar to using a generic message such as \"You are a helpful assistant.\"\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"user\"}` : The user messages provide requests or comments for the assistant to respond to.\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"assistant\"}` : Assistant messages store previous assistant responses, but can also be written by you to give examples of desired behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You start with a system message that outlines how the LLM should respond, what kind of behaviours you can expect from it, and more\n",
    "2. Then, you can provide a few examples in the form of \"assistant\"/\"user\" pairs\n",
    "3. Then, you prompt the model with the true \"user\" message.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we'll be forgoing the 2nd step for simplicities sake."

      "The best way to write a loop in Python often depends on the specific situation and what you are trying to accomplish. Here are some common types of loops in Python and best practices for each:\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. Using a `for` Loop\n",
      "\n",
      "The `for` loop is often the most straightforward way to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string):\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# Example: Looping through a list\n",
      "fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\n",
      "for fruit in fruits:\n",
      "    print(fruit)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Best Practices with `for` Loops:\n",
      "- Use `for` loops when you know the number of iterations ahead of time.\n",
      "- Use the `enumerate()` function if you need both the index and the value during iteration:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):\n",
      "    print(f\"{index}: {fruit}\")\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Using a `while` Loop\n",
      "\n",
      "The `while` loop is useful if you want to repeat a block of code as long as a condition is true:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# Example: Loop until a condition is met\n",
      "count = 0\n",
      "while count < 5:\n",
      "    print(count)\n",
      "    count += 1\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Best Practices with `while` Loops:\n",
      "- Use `while` loops when the number of iterations is not known beforehand.\n",
      "- Be careful to avoid infinite loops by ensuring the condition will eventually be false.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Using List Comprehensions\n",
      "\n",
      "If the goal of your loop is to create a new list based on an existing one, consider using a list comprehension instead:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# Example: Generating a list of squared numbers\n",
      "squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Best Practices with List Comprehensions:\n",
      "- Use list comprehensions for cleaner and faster code when transforming lists.\n",
      "- Ensure that the expression is simple enough for readability.\n",
      "\n",
      "### General Tips:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Always strive for readability in your loops. Clear code is better than clever code.\n",
      "- Avoid deep nesting of loops; if you find yourself doing this, consider refactoring.\n",
      "- Use the `break` and `continue` statements judiciously to manage loop flow.\n",
      "\n",
      "By following these guidelines, you'll be well-equipped to write effective and efficient loops in Python! If you have a specific scenario in mind, feel free to share, and I would be happy to help further!\n"

It is particularly beneficial in scenarios where the total amount of data fluctuates, and there is a need to split data into shards managed by different servers.\n\nThe jump consistent hash algorithm, for instance, can take a key and a number of buckets, returning one of the buckets. One of its key properties is that it balances the number of keys that map to each bucket and minimizes changes to the key-to-bucket mapping when the number of buckets changes. This means that only a small number (rather than all) of data items need to be moved when reassigning keys to buckets when the number of buckets is altered.\n\nIn practical terms, consistent hashing allows for efficient management of data in applications such as data storage systems and web caching, ensuring data is evenly distributed and minimizing the data movement necessary when changes occur. This makes consistent hashing especially useful in applications where quick access to distributed data is crucial and where the system needs to scale by adding or removing resources."
